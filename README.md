# code-at-home

Two exercises to code at home or at work before interview.

You will find the instructions in the README files in each folder inside [src/main/java/com/expedia/interview](https://github.com/FabienLauf/code-at-home/tree/master/src/main/java/com/expedia/interview)

All Exercise classes have a main function so you can run test cases to test your code.

## Contribution steps:

 1. **Fork** this repository
 2. Add your code to the corresponding Java files in the `src` folder.
 3. When done, send us the URL of your Fork.
 
## Requirements:

- You can start with any Exercise you want.
- You shouldn't take more than **an hour** to complete them.
- It is OK not to complete everything in **one hour**. We can still evaluate your code if it's not complete.
- The code must be production ready.
